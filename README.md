A challenge made to practice my skills in early React concepts.

## What are these challenges?

You can find a lot of my repositories with "ignite-react" at the final of their names, these repositories are challenges made by Rocketseat in their course named "Ignite"

In this challenge, I needed to make functional an application that makes to-do lists.
